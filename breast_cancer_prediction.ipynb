    "\n",
    "According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) breast cancer is the most common type of cancer for women regardless of race and ethnicity (CDC, 2016). Around 220,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer each year in the United States (CDC, 2016). Although we may not be aware of all the factors contributing in developing breast cancer, certain attributes such as family history, age, obesity, alcohol and tobacco use have been identified from research studies on this topic (DeSantis, Ma, Bryan, & Jemal, 2014). \n"

    "#### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "This project focuses in investigating the probability of predicting the type of breast cancer (malignant or benign) from the given characteristics of breast mass computed from digitized images.  This project will examine the data available and attempt to predict the possibility that a breast cancer diagnosis is malignant or benign based on the attributes collected from the breast mass. Various classifiers can be used to solve this problem, k-nearest, logistic regression, SVM, QDA, and others. A comparison of classifiers may be needed. \n"

    "##### Benchmark Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The highest accuracy the better the model will be predicting whether a person diagnosed with breast cancer has a benign or malignant tumor. To form a solid idea on the benchmark models, I perused the research literature on the same topic – predicting the type of cancer from computer-generated images.  One study that uses mammogram images of 200 cases and utilizes both k-nearest and SVM methods to classify the type of cancer achieved specificity of 92.10% with standard deviation of 2.75 and accuracy levels of 92.16% with standard deviation of 3.60 (Zhang, Wang & Yang, 2016).  Another study that suggests the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) instead of ultrasound to detect the type of breast cancer among diagnosed women, utilized a sample of 110 lymph nodes from pre-operative MRIs. They achieved an accuracy level of 79.1%, and was considered much superior to the ultrasound (Chung, Hyun, Kim, Gweon, Kim, Ryu, & Son, 2014).  A third study that also compares the accuracy levels of ultrasounds and mammography, found that mammography images are a better predictor than ultrasounds at accuracy levels of 90.7% (Tozaki & Fukuma, 2011).  Judging from these three different studies on this similar topic, I calculated an average of accuracy levels of 87.32%.  Therefore, my benchmark levels will be 87% or higher.  \n"

    "F1 score is a measure of accuracy or the ratio of the data that was accurately predicted. The closer the F-score is to 1 the best the prediction is and the closer to 0 it is, the worse the prediction. F-score considers the true positives and the true negatives, and is best used when comparing various classifiers as I am proposing to do in this dataset.  From the literature, I reached the conclusion that F-score is the best evaluation metric to be used for this type of classification problem.  The formula for the F1 score from the sklearn documentation is F1 = 2* (precision * recall) / (precision + recall). \n"
